# Adafruit-Macropad-RP2040-macro-ducky.py
  
A working Adafruit Macropad RP2040 python script with a couple of silly examples of the almighty David Hasselhoff attack!  
Please, read the comments in the script for further information.

Tested with Windows 10 and Windows 7.

### Purpose
The purpose of this Macropad config file is to demonstrate in a funny way the vulnerabilities of an unlocked and unattended workstation.
  
### Usage
Just drag & drop the ducky.py file into your macros folder and execute it from your macropad.
If you wish to change the wallpaper just substitute the current URL with something else more evil (i.e. a fake ransomware warning, a BSOD, etc.)...or not!
  
### Terms and Conditions of Usage
Please, refer to the LICENSE contained in this repository for further information.
  
### To Do
Integrate with the Adafruit CircuitPython Ducky library.  
Perhaps use more vars to simplify and modularize the declaration of the keypresses.
